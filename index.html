        Pinnacle Claims Management, Inc. For Labor Code Violations</h2>
</section>

<section class="main-content">
    <p>
        We have filed a Private Attorney General Act lawsuit against Pinnacle Claims Management, Inc. (“Pinnacle”) 
        in Orange County Superior Court, Case No. 30-2015-00788841-CU-OE-CJC.
    </p>

    <h3>This is not a lawsuit against you; you are not being sued.</h3>

    <p>
        The plaintiff in this lawsuit, Savanna Epps, was formerly employed by Pinnacle and has filed a representative 
        action on behalf of certain current and former non-exempt employees of Pinnacle. If you are or were a non-exempt 
        employee of Pinnacle or Western Growers’ Association who worked in California during the period from February 20, 
        2014 to the present, you may be a member of the group of employees Ms. Epps seeks to represent.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ms. Epps alleges that Pinnacle failed to provide legally-mandated meal periods and rest breaks, failed to pay all 
        overtime wages and minimum wages, failed to provide accurate wage statements, and failed to pay all wages on termination 
        of employment. For example, Ms. Epps alleges that employees did not receive a second meal period when they worked more 
        than 10 hours in a day, and that Pinnacle failed to pay employees for all hours worked and failed to pay overtime when 
        employees worked more than 40 hours in a week, amongst other violations.
    </p>

    <h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR SIGNED AUTHORIZATION</h3>

    <p>
        We plan on using time and payroll records for employees at Pinnacle to establish that Pinnacle employees did not receive 
        a second meal period when they worked more than 10 hours in a day and that Pinnacle did not pay employees overtime when 
        they worked more than 40 hours in a week.  In addition, we believe that Pinnacle failed to pay its employees for time spent 
        waiting for their computers to boot and starting their computer systems before logging in. Your time and payroll records will 
        help to establish the amount of unpaid wages and missed meal break penalties that Pinnacle owes its current and former employees. 
        Your time and payroll records will also help to establish that Pinnacle violated the law. That is why we need your help.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please give us authorization to request your records. Your authorization will help us fight for you and your co-workers to obtain 
        the best result in this litigation. A Private Attorney General Lawsuit is not the same as a class action lawsuit. We do not know 
        who will be in or out of the case until the trial. The best way to make sure you can participate in the possible benefits this 
        lawsuit can bring is to sign an authorization. We are not sure what will happen to those people who do not sign authorizations. 
        There has been no formal ruling by the Court on who is in or if anyone is out; we think it is best to be safe than sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, to help make sure you get paid if we win, you need to send us back your written authorization.
    </p>

    <h3>WE NEED PERSONNEL RECORDS TOO</h3>

    <p>
        Pinnacle claims that employees could take second meal breaks or signed second meal period waivers.  We need personnel records to 
        establish that Pinnacle employees did not take breaks and did not sign waivers.  We also believe that Pinnacle retaliated against 
        employees who complained about the company’s pay and meal break practices. We are looking for people who received write-ups for 
        complaining. That’s why we are asking for performance records and documents you signed (write-ups usually require acknowledgement 
        by the employee).
    </p>

    <h3>THE JACKSON LEWIS LAW FIRM REPRESENTS PINNACLE</h3>

    <p>
        Pinnacle has hired the law firm of Jackson Lewis, P.C. to defend the corporation. The corporation’s lawyers or investigators 
        may contact you to seek information to help Pinnacle win. They might try to get written statements from current and former 
        employees regarding the issues in this lawsuit and even offer money to settle this case. If you choose to speak to the corporation’s
        representatives, please remember they do not represent your interests as an aggrieved employee. Rather, they have a duty to defend 
        the corporation by outright defeating this lawsuit and/or reducing the value of your recovery. Everything you say to the corporation’s 
        attorneys could be used for their goal: defeating the lawsuit and/or reducing your recovery.
    </p>

    <h3>CASE STATUS</h3>

    <p>
        The Court has not yet set a trial date. But your input is still very important to the case, to help us win at trial and make sure you get paid if we do win.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are experienced in handling these types of cases and have successfully prosecuted many similar cases as class actions and are 
        fighting several similar cases under the same Private Attorney General Act.
    </p>

    <p>
        We must show the Court that employees were harmed by Pinnacle’s policies and practices that violated California meal break laws, rest
        break laws, minimum wage laws and overtime laws.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have written to your because we assume you would like to know about this lawsuit and because we would like to speak with any 
        current or former hourly paid employees about their experiences working for Pinnacle. On the other hand, we don’t want to bother 
        anyone who is not interested. Please let us know if you do or do not want to receive more information about the case, including 
        updates on the progress of the case, by either calling us or emailing us. If you tell us you don’t want to be contacted, we will 
        note that in our records and respect your wishes.
